Codeplex documentation:

Project Description This project provides a high performance DI framework by eliminating all runtime reflection through the use of lambdas and generic functions as factories.

Developed entirely in C# using TDD, it's a container you can crack open and actually understand to the core.

To follow the entire process of creating Funq applying test-driven development, make sure you watch the Funq Screencast Series

Read the Getting Started guide.
